### Current Versions of [Appropriate Use Agreement](redcap-use-agreement.pdf) and [Appropriate Use Policy](redcap-use-policy.pdf).

If you want to download any of these documents, click on the link, and then click on the new page's "Raw" button in the upper right corner.

The two documents in this folder are identical to
* [`/archived/2014-02-10-redcap-use-agreement.docx`](../archived/2014-02-10-redcap-use-agreement.docx)
* [`/archived/2014-03-14-redcap-use-policy.docx`](../archived/2014-03-14-redcap-use-policy.docx)

The names have been changed (by remove the dates) so future links will correctly point to the most recent version.  When these documents are updated in the future, please (a) add the new versions to the [archived](../archived) directory, with the date in the file name, and (b) replace the docx and pdf versions in this [agreements](.) directory.
